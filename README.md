# The Drop


here's an unpretentious little game that helped me learn a lot about C, including dynamic lists, and gave me a better understanding of pointers and memory allocation.

Game description
you're going to fall into a big hole, you'll have to avoid all the obstacles whatever bonus will be offered to help you.
- the purple apple (add scores)
- the rope (slow down the fall)
- the bomb (destroy obstacle)

I maybe add textures to the rope,the  bomb and the apple, but maybe not, don't count on it but if it pops enjoy

have fun
